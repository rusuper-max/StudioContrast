# Claude Design System Prompt

Reverse-engineered system prompt of Claude Design from Anthropic.

A system prompt and skill library that turns an LLM into an opinionated, accessibility-aware, AI-slop-resistant design collaborator.

Open source, MIT licensed. Drop the prompt into any LLM that supports system prompts (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models) and pair with the procedural skills as needed.

## What this is

Most "design assistant" prompts produce generic SaaS-template output — aggressive gradients, emoji decoration, rounded-corner-with-left-border cards, Inter-everywhere typography. This prompt explicitly rejects those patterns and replaces them with a complete design philosophy covering:

- Content discipline (no filler — every element earns its place)
- Aesthetic discipline (avoid AI tropes, commit to a palette and tone)
- Visual hierarchy and rhythm (size, color, weight, position, density, spacing scales)
- Accessibility (WCAG, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus rings, motion preferences)
- Interaction and feedback (hover, active, disabled, focus, loading, validation states)
- System thinking (components and tokens over one-off pages)
- Respecting the medium (real CSS Grid, `oklch()`, `text-wrap: pretty`, real interactive prototypes)
- Quality over quantity (depth over breadth, polish every detail)

Plus 14 procedural skills the agent can invoke for production, extraction, and review work.

## How to use it

### Use the system prompt directly

Paste the contents of `system-prompt.md` as the system prompt for any LLM that supports them. The agent will follow the design philosophy and reference the skills by name when tasks match.

### Use the skills as procedures

Each skill in `skills/` is a self-contained, phased procedure. The skill name is the trigger — when the user's request matches a skill description, the agent loads that skill and follows it.

Skills group into three categories:

**Production** — build something
`discovery-questions` · `frontend-aesthetic-direction` · `wireframe` · `make-a-deck` · `make-a-prototype` · `make-tweakable` · `generate-variations`

**System** — extract structure
`design-system-extract` · `component-extract`

**Review** — audit and fix
`accessibility-audit` · `ai-slop-check` · `hierarchy-rhythm-review` · `interaction-states-pass` · `polish-pass`

Skills can be chained. A typical greenfield flow:

```
discovery-questions → frontend-aesthetic-direction → wireframe → make-a-prototype → polish-pass
```

A brand-aware flow:

```
design-system-extract → generate-variations → make-tweakable → polish-pass
```

### Adapt for your platform

The prompt assumes an HTML-output design environment (similar to Claude.ai's design tool). If your target environment is different — a Figma plugin, a code-only assistant, a chat-only design coach — you'll need to adjust the workflow chapters and tool references. The principles (chapters 5–16) translate to any medium.

## Model calibration

The `claude/` variant is calibrated for current Anthropic frontier models (Fable 5 and the Opus 4.7/4.8 lineage), which follow instructions more literally and need less aggressive prompting than earlier generations:

- **Conditions instead of quotas.** No "ask at least N questions", no "CRITICAL: YOU MUST". Current models treat quotas as literal contracts and over-trigger on them; the prompt states the conditions under which to act, plus an autonomy clause for minor decisions (pick a reasonable option and note it, rather than asking).
- **Explicit triggers for skills and subagents.** These models under-reach for optional capabilities by default, so every skill description states *when* to invoke it, and verifier delegation has an explicit trigger ("after every substantive visual change").
- **Coverage-first reviews.** Review agents report everything with confidence/severity estimates and let the aggregation step filter. Current models follow "only report important issues" literally, which silently suppresses findings.
- **House-style guard.** The current models' default aesthetic (cream background, serif display type, terracotta/amber accents) is detected by `ai-slop-check` (rule 9) and pre-empted by `frontend-aesthetic-direction`'s four-directions protocol. Sampling parameters (`temperature`) no longer exist on these models, so visual variety must come from explicit per-variation specs, not randomness.

On older models (Claude Opus/Sonnet 4.6 and earlier, or non-Anthropic models), the calmer phrasing may under-trigger — restore stronger imperative language if you see the model skipping question rounds or reviews. The `codex/` variant is maintained separately and is unaffected by these notes.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Particularly useful contributions:

- Additional review skills (e.g., copy review, motion review, dark-mode parity check)
- Adapted prompts for other environments (Figma, code-only, terminal-only)
- Real-world failure cases the prompt should defend against
- Translations of the prompt into other languages

Please keep the same operational tone and avoid bloating the prompt — every chapter should earn its place, the same standard the prompt holds the agent to.
